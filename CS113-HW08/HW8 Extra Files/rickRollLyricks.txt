We are no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitments what I am thinking of
You would not get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I am feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We have known each other for so long
Your hearts been aching but
You are too shy to say it
Inside we both know what is been going on
We know the game and we are gonna play it

And if you ask me how I am feeling
Do not tell me you are too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Ooh give you up
Ooh give you up
Never gonna give never gonna give
Give you up
Never gonna give never gonna give
Give you up

We have known each other for so long
Your hearts been aching but
you are too shy to say it
Inside, we both know what is been going on
We know the game and we are gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I am feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
