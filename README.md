# CS113
Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms at MiraCosta College. In this class
we learn the most common and basic data structures that are used in CS. We, for example,
learned about stacks and queues, linked lists, various tree structures such as an AVL tree
hash tables and more. Least to say that I really loved this class.
Checkout the Final Project, it's really great!

Every one of the folders has their own README which goes more in depth of what that
homework entailed, so I will name the overarching theme of the homework and then
link to that README.

## Homework, Group Projects, and Final Project
#### Homeworks:
- [Homework 1:](CS113-HW01/README.md) Big-O Runtime (I solved this O(1) using reflection and now am the example of what not to do lol)
- [Homework 2:](CS113-HW02/README.md) Here we were supposed to create a small website
- [Homework 3:](CS113-HW03/README.md) In this homework we learned using interfaces and were allowed to use the built in Linked List to create a simple Polynomial Calculator
- [Homework 4:](CS113-HW04/README.md) We had to create our own Linked List implementation
- [Homework 5:](CS113-HW05/README.md) Using the previous homework we had to create a doubly linked list
- [Homework 6:](CS113-HW06/README.md) In this homework we learned about Stacks
- [Homework 7:](CS113-HW07/README.md) Here we used a Queue and also started using recursion
- [Homework 8:](CS113-HW08/README.md) We were tasked with building a morse code tree, our first binary tree
- [Homework 9:](CS113-HW09/README.md) In this homework we built a Huffman tree for compression
- [Homework 10:](CS113-HW10/README.md) This homework made us build a hash table with chaining
- [Homework 11:](CS113-HW11/README.md) Our last homework had us build an self balancing AVL tree. (This was not fun)

#### Group Projects:
- [Group project 1:](CS113-GroupProject01/README.md) Big Integer Class using Linked List
- [Group project 2:](CS113-GroupProject02/README.md) Calculator which uses Infix/Postfix

#### Final Project:
- [Final Project:](CS113-FinalGroupProject/README.md) Built a route planning/map tool of MiraCosta using Djikstra's algorithm.
